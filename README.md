# pyautogui-crosshatching

Open a drawing program (KolourPaint if you're based, mspaint if you're using windows), and run the script with an image as the argument. Make sure that the image isn't too big or it'll probably begin trying to draw outside your screen which isn't ideal.

In case you wan't to escape its hold, pyautogui stops if you move your mouse to the top left corner.
